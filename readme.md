Staying at home has become a norm & older folks have had it the worst. Among the skyrocketing rates of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, reduced mobility &  joint problems, etc. the need for a strong and constant connection between the physiotherapist and the elderly has become apparent.

We would use ML and computer vision to track daily and regular exercises along with the range of motion and rep count. All the data collected would then be parsed by the family physiotherapist. The app would also have various other tools to check and help elderly people to be healthier.

## Installation

You can download the zip file and run our ligament tracking ML model on on your local system from [SHRAVAN](https://github.com/Bigguysahaj/ALDERLy) and also we have build and deployed our [Web Page](https://adithyanmadhu1234.wixsite.com/elderly) on velo so you can check that out too.


## Usage

#### The Web app provides following functionalities :
- Ligament tracking ML-model useing computer vision.
- Footstep leaderboard
- Medical Support Contacts

### Ligament tracking ML-model useing computer vision.
We made an ML-Model using computer vision in order to track ligament moments, so that we could track elderly people while exercising, and guide them through the process.
